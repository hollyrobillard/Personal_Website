                <h2>Meet Holly</h2>
                <p>
                    I am motivated to go to work every single day because I know I can make a difference in my industry, my workplace, and the world I touch, making it better than it was yesterday.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I strive to be a servant leader that lifts up my team and makes their work lives better. I might be a natural extrovert but I prioritize hearing all voices in the room, especially the silent, before I speak. I seek to break down silos and connect functions together as one team to bring exciting innovations to life. I thrive when no one day is alike and I enjoy overcoming unexpected challenges with my team. I enjoy setting strategic priorities with management and working with my team to deliver even greater wins for the customer than originally expected. I truly believe in a design-to-value approach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of my core responsibilities, I look for broadening opportunities to act as a product manager. I am constantly finding new learning opportunities but these are just a few of my focus areas:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I am more than halfway done with my second Bachelors degree in Information Technology (IT) with a concentration in data analytics and artificial intelligence.</li>
                    <li>I aim to complete my Dynamic Leadership pathway with Toastmasters International through Express Yourself Toastmasters before the end of this summer.</li>
                    <li>I am working on a personal training certification through NASM in my free time.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    In my free time, I am an avid foodie, focused on promoting nutrition and healthy, balanced eating. You can follow my journey on Instagram (@worklifemeals) where I support local restaurants and cook homemade meals. I am also passionate about fitness and general wellness. Ask me about my love for dragon boating.
